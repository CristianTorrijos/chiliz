# BAR Token Project
### By Cristian Torrijos LÃ¡zaro (c@cristian.pro)

This project is divided into two main parts: `part1-final` and `part2-final`, each focusing on different aspects of the BAR token ecosystem.

## Part 1 - ERC20 Token Transfer Tracking
In `part1-final`, we focus on tracking ERC20 token transfers for the BAR token. This includes scripting and analysis of transfer data.

## Part 2 - Staking and Survey Platform
In `part2-final`, we develop a staking platform for the BAR token, enabling users to participate in surveys based on their staked tokens.
